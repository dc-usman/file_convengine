To build a file conversion tool in Laravel, you can follow these steps:

Install Laravel: If you haven't already, install Laravel by following the official documentation.

Set up a new Laravel project: Create a new Laravel project using the Laravel CLI command laravel new project-name.

Create a form: Create a form in your Laravel application's view to allow users to upload a Word file.

Handle file upload: In your Laravel controller, handle the file upload by validating the file and storing it in a temporary location.

Convert the file: Use a library like phpoffice/phpword to convert the Word file to PDF. You can install this library using Composer.

Save the converted file: Save the converted PDF file to a desired location on your server.

Provide download link: Once the conversion is complete, provide a download link to the user so they can download the converted PDF file.

Clean up: Delete the temporary Word and PDF files from your server to keep it clean.

Remember to handle any error scenarios and provide appropriate feedback to the user throughout the process.

This is a high-level overview of the procedure. You will need to dive into the specific details of each step and write the necessary code to achieve the desired functionality.
